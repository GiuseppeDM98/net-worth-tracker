## 🧪 Development Features

### Test Snapshot Generator

For development and testing purposes, the application includes a **bulk test snapshot generator** that creates realistic historical data to test charts, statistics, and UI components.

#### How to Enable

1. **Set environment variable** in your `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEST_SNAPSHOTS=true
   ```

2. **Navigate to Settings page** in the application

3. **Scroll to "Funzionalità di Sviluppo"** section (only visible when enabled)

4. **Click "Genera Snapshot di Test"** button

#### What It Does

The test data generator creates:

**1. Historical Monthly Snapshots** (going back N months, configurable up to 120)
- Initial net worth: Configurable (default: €50,000)
- Monthly growth rate: Configurable average portfolio growth (default: 0.8% → ~10% annual)
- Asset allocation: 85% liquid / 15% illiquid
- Asset class distribution: 60% equity, 25% bonds, 8% crypto, 5% real estate, 2% cash
- **Realistic asset class returns** with different volatilities:
  - **Equity** (60%): ~1.0% monthly (~12% annual), volatility ~5% annual
  - **Bonds** (25%): ~0.4% monthly (~5% annual), volatility ~1.5% annual
  - **Crypto** (8%): ~1.2% monthly (~15% annual), volatility ~10% annual (high risk)
  - **Real Estate** (5%): ~0.6% monthly (~7% annual), volatility ~1% annual
  - **Cash** (2%): ~0.2% monthly (~2.4% annual, inflation), minimal volatility
- 10 dummy assets: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, BTC, ETH, US Treasury, Corporate Bonds, Real Estate Fund, Cash EUR
- Random but realistic price variations using normal distribution (Box-Muller transform)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Each asset class grows **independently** with its own return rate and volatility
- Equity, bonds, crypto, real estate, and cash are tracked separately month-by-month
- Portfolio value is recalculated as sum of all asset classes each month
- This creates realistic correlation and diversification effects
- Asset allocation percentages vary over time based on performance (e.g., if equity outperforms, its percentage increases)
- **Perfect for testing Monte Carlo simulations** with historical data that has proper equity/bonds differentiation

**2. Expenses & Income Data** (optional, enabled by default)
- **Income entries**: 1-2 per month with ±8% variation
  - Categories: Stipendio, Freelance, Investimenti, Altro
- **Fixed expenses**: Constant with ±3% variation (35% of total expenses)
  - Categories: Affitto, Utenze, Abbonamenti
- **Variable expenses**: 8-15 entries per month with ±40% variation (50% of total expenses)
  - Categories: Spesa, Trasporti, Svago, Shopping
- **Debts**: Nearly constant with ±1% variation (15% of total expenses)
  - Categories: Mutuo, Prestito Auto
- Realistic date distribution throughout each month

#### Parameters

When you click the button, a modal allows you to configure:

**Patrimonio (Net Worth):**
- **Patrimonio Iniziale** (Initial Net Worth): Starting amount in EUR (default: €50,000)
- **Tasso di Crescita Mensile** (Monthly Growth Rate): Average monthly portfolio growth percentage (default: 0.8% → ~10% annual). Realistic range: 0.5-1.0% for typical portfolios
- **Numero di Mesi** (Number of Months): How many months to generate (1-120, default: 24)

**Spese ed Entrate (optional toggle):**
- **Entrate Mensili Medie** (Average Monthly Income): Mean monthly income in EUR (default: €3,000)
- **Spese Mensili Medie** (Average Monthly Expenses): Mean monthly expenses in EUR (default: €2,500)

#### 🏷️ Dummy Data Identification

All test data generated by this feature is marked with special identifiers for easy management:

- **Snapshots**: Have `isDummy: true` field in the database
- **Expenses**: Have IDs starting with `dummy-` (e.g., `dummy-income-...`, `dummy-fixed-...`)
- **Categories**: Have IDs starting with `dummy-category-` (e.g., `dummy-category-income-stipendio`)

This naming convention allows you to identify and remove all test data at once.

#### ⚠️ Important Warning

**Test data is saved to the same Firebase collections as real data:**
- Snapshots → `monthly-snapshots` collection (with `isDummy: true`)
- Expenses → `expenses` collection (with IDs starting with `dummy-`)
- Categories → `expenseCategories` collection (with IDs starting with `dummy-category-`)

All test data will appear in your charts, statistics, and Hall of Fame alongside real data.

#### 🗑️ Removing Test Data

You have two options to remove test data:

**Option 1: Use the Built-in Delete Button (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to **Settings** page in the application
2. Scroll to **"Funzionalità di Sviluppo"** section
3. Click **"Elimina Tutti i Dati Dummy"** button
4. Review the count of items to be deleted
5. Confirm deletion

This will remove all dummy snapshots, expenses, and categories in one operation.

**Option 2: Manual Firebase Console Deletion**
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Select your project
4. Delete test documents from these collections:
   - `monthly-snapshots`: Documents with `isDummy: true` field
   - `expenses`: Documents with IDs starting with `dummy-`
   - `expenseCategories`: Documents with IDs starting with `dummy-category-`

**Recommendation**: Only use this feature in a development/test environment or in a separate Firebase project to avoid mixing test data with real financial data.

#### Use Cases

- **Testing charts** with historical data without waiting months for real snapshots
- **Hall of Fame testing** with realistic income/expense variations to see best/worst months and years
- **FIRE calculator testing** with actual expense data to validate sustainable withdrawal calculations
- **Monte Carlo simulation testing** with realistic equity/bonds returns and volatilities that differ appropriately (equity higher return/volatility, bonds lower)
- **Expense analytics testing** to verify category breakdowns, trends, and monthly comparisons
- **UI development** to see how components handle different data scales and edge cases
- **Performance testing** with large datasets (up to 120 months of data)
- **Demo purposes** to showcase the application's full capabilities
- **Development** of new features requiring historical portfolio and expense data

### Understanding Income-to-Expense Ratio

The **Income-to-Expense Ratio** metric provides instant insight into your financial health by comparing total income against total expenses for the selected period.

**Interpreting the ratio:**

1. Navigate to **"Tracciamento Spese"** (Expense Tracking)
2. Select a year (e.g., 2025)
3. View the **"Rapporto Entrate/Spese"** card (fourth metric)

**What the colors mean:**

🟢 **Green (≥1.2)** - "Salute finanziaria ottima"
- Example: Ratio 1.49 (Income: €53,051, Expenses: €35,581)
- You're earning significantly more than you spend
- Strong savings potential and financial cushion
- Ideal for building wealth and reaching FIRE goals

🟡 **Yellow (0.8-1.2)** - "In equilibrio"
- Example: Ratio 1.05 (Income: €3,150, Expenses: €3,000)
- Income slightly exceeds expenses
- Balanced budget with modest savings
- Consider optimizing expenses or increasing income

🔴 **Red (<0.8)** - "Attenzione alle spese"
- Example: Ratio 0.65 (Income: €2,600, Expenses: €4,000)
- Spending more than you earn
- Unsustainable long-term without drawing from savings
- Review budget and identify areas to reduce expenses

⚪ **Gray (N/A)** - "Nessuna spesa registrata"
- No expense data available for the selected period
- Start tracking expenses to see your ratio

**Year-over-year comparison:**
- Change year filter to compare financial health across different periods
- Track improvement over time as you optimize spending
- Set personal goals (e.g., maintain ratio ≥1.3 for aggressive savings)

**Example scenarios:**

*Aggressive saver for FIRE:*
- Income: €4,000/month
- Expenses: €2,200/month
- Ratio: 1.82 (green) → Saving ~45% of income

*Living paycheck to paycheck:*
- Income: €2,800/month
- Expenses: €2,750/month
- Ratio: 1.02 (yellow) → Saving only 2%, vulnerable to emergencies

*Overspending situation:*
- Income: €3,500/month
- Expenses: €4,200/month
- Ratio: 0.83 (yellow, close to red) → Burning savings, needs budget review

### Managing Specific Asset Allocation Targets

The **Specific Asset Allocation Tracking** feature allows you to define granular target allocations for individual stocks, ETFs, or other assets within your subcategories.

**When to use this:**
- You want precise control over which tickers to hold within a subcategory
- Track allocation to specific stocks like "AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN" within your "Single Stock" allocation
- Monitor target percentages for individual ETFs in your "All-World" or "Momentum" strategies

**How to set up specific asset tracking:**

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Sotto-Categorie** section
2. Find the subcategory you want to track (e.g., "Single Stock" under Equity)
3. Enable the **"Abilita tracciamento asset specifici"** toggle
4. Click **"Mostra specific assets"** to expand the configuration
5. Click **"+ Aggiungi Specific Asset"**
6. Enter:
   - **Ticker/Nome**: AAPL (or asset name)
   - **Target %**: 25 (percentage relative to the subcategory)
7. Add more specific assets until the total equals 100%
8. The system validates that percentages sum to exactly 100%
9. Click **"Salva Impostazioni"**

**Example configuration:**

If your allocation is:
- **Equity**: 60% of total portfolio (€60,000)
- **Single Stock**: 6% of Equity (€3,600)

Set specific assets within "Single Stock":
- AAPL: 25% → Target: €900 (1.5% of total Equity)
- MSFT: 25% → Target: €900 (1.5% of total Equity)
- GOOGL: 25% → Target: €900 (1.5% of total Equity)
- AMZN: 25% → Target: €900 (1.5% of total Equity)

**Viewing specific asset allocation in Allocation page:**

1. Navigate to **Allocazione Asset** page
2. Scroll to the subcategory section (e.g., "Sotto-Categoria Azioni")
3. Look for subcategories with the **ℹ️ info icon**
4. **Click on the row** to drill down
5. View the detailed breakdown:
   - **Asset Name**: Specific ticker or asset name (e.g., "AAPL", "Enel")
   - **Target %**: Target percentage (relative to subcategory)
   - **Target €**: Target value in euros
   - **Current %/€**: Automatically calculated by matching real portfolio assets
   - **Difference**: Shows how much to buy or sell to reach target
   - **Action**: COMPRA, VENDI, or OK (threshold: ±100€)
6. Use the **← back button** to return to the main view

**Important notes:**
- Specific assets are **automatically linked** to your real portfolio assets based on ticker/name matching
- The system performs case-insensitive partial matching on both ticker and asset name
- Current values are calculated by summing all matching assets in your portfolio
- Example: A specific asset "Enel" will automatically match any portfolio asset with "enel" in its ticker or name
- Use the "Action" column to see buy/sell recommendations to reach your targets

**Benefits:**
- More granular portfolio rebalancing guidance
- Better visibility into desired individual asset allocation
- Flexibility to enable tracking only for subcategories where you need detail
- Maintains consistency with existing allocation tracking UX

### Tracking FIRE Progress

1. Navigate to **"FIRE"** page
2. Set **Safe Withdrawal Rate**: 4.0%
3. (Optional) Set **Planned Annual Expenses**: €25,000

   - Monthly Allowance (sustainable withdrawal)
   - Years of Expenses remaining
5. Compare current vs planned scenarios
6. Track progress month-over-month with historical chart

### Tracking Cost Basis and Taxes

1. Navigate to **"Patrimonio"** (Assets)
2. Click on an existing asset or create a new one
3. Enable **"Tracciamento Cost Basis"** toggle
4. Enter:
   - **Costo Medio per Azione**: €85.50 (your average purchase price)
   - **Aliquota Fiscale**: 26 (tax rate percentage)
5. Save the asset
6. View on Dashboard:
   - **Patrimonio Totale Lordo/Netto**: Gross and net total worth
   - **Patrimonio Liquido Lordo/Netto**: Gross and net liquid worth
   - **Plusvalenze Non Realizzate**: Unrealized gains (green) or losses (red)
   - **Tasse Stimate**: Estimated taxes on gains

### Simulating Asset Sales with Tax Calculator

Before selling an asset, you can simulate the tax impact to understand your net proceeds.

**Prerequisites:**
- Asset must have **cost basis tracking enabled** (average cost and tax rate configured)

**How to use:**

1. Navigate to **"Patrimonio"** (Assets) page
2. Find the asset you want to simulate selling
3. Click the **blue calculator icon** (🧮) in the Actions column
4. The Tax Calculator modal opens with asset details

**Selling by Quantity:**
1. Select **"Per Quantità"** mode (default)
2. Enter how many shares/units to sell (e.g., 10)
3. View instant calculations:
   - Total sale value (gross)
   - Capital gain or loss (+€200 or -€150)
   - Taxes owed (€52 on gains, €0 on losses)
   - Net proceeds after taxes

**Selling by Target Value:**
1. Select **"Per Valore Target"** mode
2. Enter desired gross sale amount (e.g., €10,000)
3. System calculates:
   - Required quantity to sell (e.g., 0.1923 BTC)
   - Resulting gains/losses
   - Taxes to pay
   - **Net proceeds** (what you'll actually receive)
4. Use the helpful message to understand: "To get €10k net, you need to sell €11.2k gross"

**Example Scenarios:**

*Profitable ETF sale:*
- Asset: VWCE.DE ETF
- Current price: €105.50, Average cost: €85.50
- Selling: 10 shares
- Result: +€200 gain (+23.4%), €52 taxes (26%), €1,003 net proceeds

*Cryptocurrency with target proceeds:*
- Asset: BTC
- Current: €52,000, Cost: €30,000
- Target: Need €10,000 cash
- Calculator shows: Must sell 0.1923 BTC (€10,000 gross), pays €1,100 taxes, nets €8,900
- **Insight**: You actually need to sell €11,235 worth to get €10k after taxes

*Loss scenario (tax loss harvesting):*
- Asset: TSLA stock
- Current: €180, Cost: €220
- Selling: 20 shares
- Result: -€800 loss (-18.2%), €0 taxes, €3,600 net proceeds
- **Note**: The modal explains that losses can offset future gains

**Benefits:**
- Make informed selling decisions before execution
- Understand true after-tax proceeds
- Plan for tax-efficient rebalancing
- Avoid surprises at tax time
- Calculate optimal sale amounts to reach net cash goals

### Viewing Gain/Loss in Assets Table

Once you've set up cost basis tracking for your assets, the **G/P (Gain/Loss) column** provides immediate visibility into each investment's performance.

#### Understanding the G/P Column

1. Navigate to **"Patrimonio"** (Assets) page
2. The G/P column appears after **"Valore Totale"** (Total Value)
3. For each asset with cost basis set:
   - **First line**: Absolute gain/loss (e.g., +€1,250.00 or -€340.00)
   - **Second line**: Percentage gain/loss (e.g., +12.5% or -4.2%)
   - **Green text**: Positive returns
   - **Red text**: Losses
4. Assets without cost basis show **"-"** in gray

#### Table Footer Totals

At the bottom of the assets table:
- **Total portfolio value**: Sum of all asset values
- **Total G/P**: Aggregate gain/loss across all assets with cost basis
  - Calculated as: Sum of all individual gains/losses
  - Percentage: (Total G/P / Total Cost Basis) × 100

#### Special Case: Real Estate with Debt

For real estate properties with outstanding mortgages, the G/P calculation follows this logic:

**Example:**
- House purchased at: €200,000 (cost basis)
- Current market value: €250,000
- Outstanding mortgage: €150,000

**What you see in the table:**
- **Valore Totale (Total Value)**: €100,000 (net value: €250k - €150k debt)
- **G/P**: +€50,000 (+25%)

**Why this calculation?**
The G/P reflects the **property's appreciation**, not your equity gain. The calculation is:
- Gain/Loss = Current Gross Value - Purchase Cost
- Gain/Loss = €250,000 - €200,000 = +€50,000
- Percentage = €50,000 / €200,000 = +25%

This approach accurately represents the investment performance of the property itself, independent of how it was financed. Your net worth correctly shows €100,000 (after debt), while the G/P shows the true appreciation of the asset (+€50,000).

### Tracking TER and Portfolio Costs

The **TER (Total Expense Ratio)** feature helps you monitor and optimize the management costs of your portfolio, particularly important for ETFs and mutual funds.

#### Setting Up TER for Assets

1. Navigate to **"Patrimonio"** (Assets) page
2. Click on an existing asset or create a new one
3. Enable **"TER (Total Expense Ratio)"** toggle
4. Enter the TER percentage (e.g., 0.20 for 0.20%)
   - Find TER in the fund's factsheet or prospectus
   - Common examples: Vanguard FTSE All-World ~0.22%, iShares Core S&P 500 ~0.07%
5. Save the asset

#### Understanding Portfolio TER Metrics

Once you've added TER data for your assets, two new cards appear in the **Dashboard Overview**:

**Portfolio TER Card (Purple)**
- Shows the weighted average TER across all your investments
- Formula: `(TER₁ × Value₁ + TER₂ × Value₂ + ...) / Total Portfolio Value`
- Only includes assets with TER defined (stocks without TER are excluded)
- Example: If you have €50k in an ETF with 0.20% TER and €30k in another with 0.50% TER, your Portfolio TER = 0.31%

**Annual Portfolio Cost Card (Orange)**
- Displays the real cost in euros you'll pay annually
- Formula: `Portfolio Value × (Portfolio TER / 100)`
- Example: €80k portfolio with 0.31% TER = €248/year in management fees

#### Viewing TER in Assets Table

The **Assets table** includes dedicated columns for cost analysis:
- **PMC (Prezzo Medio di Carico)**: Your average purchase cost per unit
- **TER**: The expense ratio for each asset (displayed in purple)
- Assets without TER show "-" in gray

#### Use Cases

**Compare Investment Options**
- ETF A: €50k, TER 0.20% → €100/year
- ETF B: €50k, TER 0.75% → €375/year
- **Savings by choosing A: €275/year**

**Optimize Existing Portfolio**
- Identify high-cost funds dragging down returns
- Calculate the impact of switching to lower-cost alternatives
- Track how costs evolve as your portfolio grows

**Real Numbers Matter**
- A 0.50% difference might sound small
- On a €100k portfolio: **€500/year difference**
- Over 30 years at 7% growth: **€47,000+ in lost returns**
